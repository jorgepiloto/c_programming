The C programming language
==========================

It's been four years since I started coding Python. It took me about a year to
feel completely comfortable with the language and devoted the rest learning
testing, documentation, packaging and others through open source projects.

As time passed, my interest on how the beautiful and powerful Python was built
increased and finally discovered that it was built with the C programming
language. 

So far so good, you can even extend Python with this classic programming
language!  That means that it might be feasible to write a C core application
which user can interface with through Python! However, this implies that
maintenance difficulty increases while packaging and shipping does it also.

I keep practicing C programming almost everyday since March 2020 and now I have
a strong knowledge on how to use pointers, double pointers, dynamic memory...
But I still require to learn more about libraries, how to document a project or
which is the most interesting testing framework for a task.


Disclaimer
----------

I follow a personal code style for C programming and try to keep it all along
my source code files. It can be considered a mix from Linux Kernel style, GNU
one and B&K book by taking my favourite parts from each one.

Furthermore, I still require to code a Makefile for better-fast building all
this repo, so user and me are able to compile and execute easier all the
different routines.


About this repo
---------------

Its only purpose is to hold different source code files and header ones on small
projects I wanted to develop in C to test my programming skills in this
language. You might find programs related to cryptography, applied mathematics
and other scientific topics.
